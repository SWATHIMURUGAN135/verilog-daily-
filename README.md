# Verilog Daily Practice – 30 Days of HDL Learning

Welcome. This repository documents my personal journey to master Verilog and SystemVerilog through consistent daily practice. Each day focuses on a small module or concept, implemented, simulated, and explained using testbenches.

## Project Structure


## How to Run the Code

You can simulate the Verilog code using:

- Xilinx ISE / Vivado
- ModelSim
- EDA Playground (Free Online Simulator)

### Steps (for Xilinx ISE):
1. Open a new project and add all `.v` files from the day's folder.
2. Set the testbench file (e.g., `*_tb.v`) as the top module.
3. Run "Simulate Behavioral Model".
4. Observe outputs in the console or waveform viewer.

## Learning Goals

- Master Verilog coding fundamentals
- Practice structural, behavioral, and testbench modeling
- Understand combinational and sequential logic design
- Build a clean HDL GitHub portfolio for internships and jobs

## About Me

I'm a student and VLSI enthusiast working toward mastering digital design one day at a time. This repo is both my practice log and a public portfolio of my progress.

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or fork this repository.

## Contributions

This is a personal learning project, but collaboration is welcome. If you'd like to suggest testcases, fixes, or improvements, feel free to open an Issue or Pull Request.

This project is focused on learning, discipline, and building strong fundamentals in hardware description languages.
